# Coworking Agreement

Talk through each section with your partner. Add notes on what you discussed and agreed upon in each section. At the bottom, type your names to sign off on your agreement.


## Accessibility Needs
*What does each team member need access to in order to succeed and show up the best they can?*

We both need Laptop ,  Liveshare , Zoom , Fixed for coworking 11:30am to 1pm and 2pm to 4pm.

## Collaboration vs. Individual Work Expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations - does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*

We plan to start by pair-programming to align on style and workflow, then later try splitting tasks—for example in Waves 3–4—to practice working independently and sharing results.
To stay connected we’ll use VS Code Live Share for real-time coding, Git/GitHub for version control, Slack and Zoom for communication, and tools like ChatGPT and Google for quick research.

## Learning Style
*How does each team member learn best in project settings?*

Kate: I usually start by reading the README to understand the project’s purpose and requirements, then review the main code and tests. I like to note the requirements as comments in the functions I plan to write and clearly define the inputs and outputs first. I’d also like to apply the problem-solving approach we practiced in the lessons.  
Divyasri: learning by doing the code , clear expectations , following the documentation and discussing each others thoughts on solving each wave.

## Preferred Feedback Style
*How does each team member best receive feedback?*

Kate: I prefer to receive feedback after I’ve finished or implemented something, rather than during the process. If there are several points to cover, I’d like to discuss them all at once. I value the chance to learn from my own mistakes, and getting feedback afterward gives me the opportunity to discover and reflect before making improvements.  
Divyasri: real time discussions , Q&A style and sometimes quick check-in's works for me.

## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
*What is a teamwork-related skill you want to work on?*

Kate: I’d like to improve how I talk about and explain my code to others, including breaking down tasks and sharing them when pairing. I also want to get better at giving and receiving feedback, practice active listening to make sure everyone feels heard, and strengthen my skills in estimating time, planning sprints or tasks, and resolving disagreements constructively.  
Divyasri: conflict resolution.

## Optional: Other agreements
*Other co-working agreements that were not captured in the above sections.*
To be respectful of each other’s time and maintain a healthy work–life balance. We’ll give advance notice if we need to adjust our co-working schedule and be mindful of breaks so we can stay focused and productive.

We will try our best to work together as much as possible and learn from each other through out the project and get successful together.
